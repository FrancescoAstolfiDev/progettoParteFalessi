# Improvement Tasks for My_Ispw2_Project_Falessi

This document contains a detailed list of actionable improvement tasks for the project. Each item starts with a placeholder [ ] to be checked off when completed.

## Architecture Improvements

1. [ ] Implement a proper layered architecture with clear separation of concerns (e.g., data access, business logic, presentation)
2. [ ] Extract interfaces for key components to improve testability and maintainability
3. [ ] Implement dependency injection instead of direct instantiation of dependencies
4. [ ] Create a service layer to encapsulate business logic
5. [ ] Refactor the MetricsCalculator class to follow the Single Responsibility Principle (it's currently too large)
6. [ ] Implement a proper error handling strategy with custom exceptions
7. [ ] Create a configuration management system instead of hardcoded constants

## Code Quality Improvements

8. [ ] Fix inconsistent code formatting and indentation throughout the codebase
9. [ ] Add comprehensive JavaDoc comments to all public classes and methods
10. [ ] Remove commented-out code and debug print statements
11. [ ] Fix code duplication in MetricsCalculator and MethodDataSetExecutor
12. [ ] Implement proper null checking and validation for method parameters
13. [ ] Fix magic numbers and strings by replacing them with named constants
14. [ ] Improve variable naming for better readability (e.g., avoid abbreviations like "iv", "ov", "fv")
15. [ ] Fix potential resource leaks by using try-with-resources for file operations
16. [ ] Implement proper logging instead of System.out.println statements
17. [ ] Fix potential concurrency issues in parallel processing code

## Configuration Improvements

18. [ ] Replace hardcoded paths in ConstantsWindowsFormat with configurable properties
19. [ ] Create a configuration file (e.g., application.properties) for all configurable parameters
20. [ ] Make the application cross-platform by avoiding Windows-specific path separators
21. [ ] Resolve the Java version inconsistency between pom.xml properties (18) and compiler plugin (16)
22. [ ] Update dependencies to their latest stable versions
23. [ ] Replace the system dependency for CK with a proper Maven dependency

## Testing Improvements

24. [ ] Implement unit tests for all core functionality
25. [ ] Implement integration tests for the complete workflow
26. [ ] Set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
27. [ ] Implement test coverage reporting
28. [ ] Create mock objects for external dependencies to improve test isolation

## Documentation Improvements

29. [ ] Create a comprehensive README.md with project overview, setup instructions, and usage examples
30. [ ] Document the data model and relationships between entities
31. [ ] Create sequence diagrams for the main workflows
32. [ ] Document the machine learning approach and evaluation metrics
33. [ ] Create a user guide for running the application with different configurations

## Performance Improvements

34. [ ] Optimize the parallel processing implementation in MetricsCalculator
35. [ ] Implement caching for frequently accessed data
36. [ ] Optimize file I/O operations
37. [ ] Profile the application to identify and fix performance bottlenecks
38. [ ] Implement batch processing for large datasets

## Feature Improvements

39. [ ] Add support for more version control systems besides Git
40. [ ] Implement more metrics for code quality analysis
41. [ ] Add visualization capabilities for the analysis results
42. [ ] Implement a command-line interface for easier usage
43. [ ] Add support for incremental analysis to avoid reprocessing unchanged files
44. [ ] Implement a plugin system for custom metrics and analyses

## Security Improvements

45. [ ] Implement secure handling of credentials for accessing repositories
46. [ ] Add input validation to prevent injection attacks
47. [ ] Implement proper access control for sensitive operations
48. [ ] Scan and fix dependencies with known vulnerabilities

## Build and Deployment Improvements

49. [ ] Create a proper release process with versioning
50. [ ] Package the application as a standalone executable
51. [ ] Create Docker containers for easy deployment
52. [ ] Implement a proper build pipeline with stages for compilation, testing, and packaging
